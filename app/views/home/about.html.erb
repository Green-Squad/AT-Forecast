    <h2 class="content-subhead">What is this?</h2>
    <p>ATForecast.com is an open source weather data aggregator specifically for shelters and campsites along the Appalachian Trail. We provide detailed forecasts and weather conditions for A.T. hikers as fast as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="content-subhead">Why did we make this?</h2>
    <p>Our goal with this project is to have the fastest and easiest to use weather service available for hikers on the Appalachian Trail. Many places on the trail have spotty cell service, so we wanted to make the pages load as fast as possible when you have that bad service connection. </p>

    <h2 id="adjusted-temp" class="content-subhead">Temperature and elevation?</h2>
    <p>As you may have noticed on your hikes, the mountain tops are colder than the valleys. Every 1,000 feet in elevation gain, the temperature decreases around an average of 3.5&deg;F to 5&deg;F. You can read more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate#Environmental_lapse_rate" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep this in mind when planning out your trip, especially when you wish to camp at higher elevations.</p>
